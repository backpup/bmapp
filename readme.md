## Bookmark App



I exclusively use my bookmarks toolbar for storing my bookmarks and always find it cluttered; litterd with bookmarks that I have forgotten why I put there unless I click them. When the time comes to hunt for one that I think I have saved, it usually involves clicking through a bunch of them. This is the main reason I built this app, so that I can have it all organized by topics right next to me, conveniently open and ready and quickly browsable with the help of titles and groups which is quite impossible with bookmarks toolbar since you want shorter titles to fit more on it.
